TypeScript is JavaScript with types. Please make smart use of types and avoid cheap copouts like using "any".

When using objects as source of truth for possible values, make use of the "as const" and "keyof" features, instead of declaring separate types / interfaces / enums.

Use modern async / await, where appropriate, but always add catch blocks or clauses when awaiting something (even if you are just rethrowing an error - doing this explicity indicates intent)!

Using functional programming is cool, but where performance is critical, go for iterators or just simple for loops.

## React

Always use functional components and extract complex logic into custom hooks.

Always use TanStack / Query when using the REST API.

Avoid complex conditional logic in render functions. Preferably use an early return pattern with a renderContent helper function like in frontend/src/pages/UnsubscribeConfirm.tsx. This keeps the actual return block of the component simple.
