# Spec Strategy

The desired behavior of the app - at least where it's not obvious from established best practices - should be documented in the doc directory. The core idea is to use yaml files in a rather intuitive way to describe the intended behavior of the app before starting with the implementation plan.

These yaml files contain:
- User stories
- Requirements
- For pages:
  - (URI/Navigation) path
  - Visible elements
  - Action descriptions for interactive elements

Other details can also be added, when clarification seems useful. Just don't go into excruciating detail - such details may be placed in comments within files, functions, or the OpenAPI documentation.

For an instructive example, see doc/features/blog.yaml

Tests should cover the visibility of specified visible elements and the behavior of the described actions. Defining the functionality covered by tests is the primary purpose of the specification files!
